#+title: Devices

All device classes should inherit from generic device class.
Generic device class specifies the following attributes:
 + ~ports~:
   Expects a dictionary with ports, where port is an instance of ~Port~ class.
 + ~power_average~:
   Average power usage; Can be set to 0 for passive devices.
 + ~power_peak~:
   Peak power usage; Can be set to 0.
 + ~reference~:
   Bib-styled reference of the model.

~GenericDevice()~ class also specifies the following methods:
 + ~__input__(self)~
 + ~register_signal~:
   Signals should be registered using this method.
   It checks if the correct type of signal is registered for the port.
 + ~compute_outputs~:
   Waits for input signals to be computed, before computing the outputs.
   The decorator ~@wait_input_comput~ blocks ~compute_outputs~ until inputs
   signals are computed.
   *This method should be extended in the specific device class*

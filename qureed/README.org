The Framework is structured in the following way:
+ *Devices*: All the devices reside here,
+ *Signals*: All the signals reside here, signals connect inputs and outputs from
  different devices.
+ *Simulation*: The logic that handles simulation flow will reside here.
+ *Extras*: Logic that is not directly linked to the simulation resides here,
  currently only the implementation of the ~Reference~ class, used by devices.

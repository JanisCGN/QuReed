#+TITLE: Kernel

The qureed kernel takes care of quantum mechanical simulations.
All of the quantum systems as well as quantum operations are
managed by the kernel.

Future features of the kernel:
  + Quantum Systems addressing:
    * Devices create and operate on quantum systems
    * Kernel keeps the record of all quantum systems
    * Signal only keep reference to the quantum systems
    * Components with the reference to the quantum system
      can operate on the actual system
  + Quantum System Exporting and Importing
    * If end user implements devices, which do not use the kernel
      they should be able to get the system out of the kernel
    * Exported object should (somehow) contain also references to the
      subsystems, which actually are accessible by the device
    * Imports should check if only the accessible parts of the quantum systems
      were modified

#+title: QuaSi: Quantum Hardware Simulation Framework

[[https://github.com/tqsd/QuaSi/actions/workflows/pylint.yml/badge.svg?branch=master]]


Framework for quantum simulations using realistic device models.

* Framework Design

** Devices
Each device design stems from the Abstract Base Class ~GenericDevice(ABC)~
implemented in [[file:./quasi/devices/generic_device.py][quasi/devices/generic_device.py]]

* Usage

* Contributing

** Developing

In order to develop the framework:
1. clone the repository,
2. create a new branch,
3. create new virtual environment:
   + with ~virtualenv~
      #+begin_src bash
   virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
      #+end_src
   + or with conda:
     TODO

4. install the package in editable mode (this also installs all of the required packages):
   #+begin_src bash
   pip install -e .
   #+end_src

Tell my coworker nicely that he should post his post on different slack channel

You could say: "Hey there, I think your post might be more relevant in a different channel. Would you mind sharing it there instead?"
